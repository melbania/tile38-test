## Description

WITHIN searches a collection for objects that are fully contained inside of a specified bounding area. 

[WITHIN](../commands/within.md) and [INTERSECTS](../commands/intersects.md) have identical syntax. The only difference between the two is that WITHIN returns objects that are *contained* inside an area, and intersects returns objects that are *contained or intersects* an area.

This command has many options, but at itâ€™s most simplest it may appear like.

```tile38-cli
WITHIN fleet BOUNDS 33.462 -112.268 33.491 -112.245
```

Above is a search around the rectangle with the southwestern point `33.462,-112.268` and the northeastern point `33.491,-112.245`. A list of all objects that are fully contained inside the rectangle are returned.

## Search Options
